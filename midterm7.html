				<p>A cognitive bias is a bad mental habit. It’s a way of thinking that might be very common and, on its surface, might even appear rational – but in fact it gets in the way of logical thinking.<br><br>

For example, if all of your friends believe something, you’re much more likely to believe it as well. That’s not a very rational basis for believing something, but it is something that almost everyone experiences at some point, and it’s a mistake that many people will repeat over and over again in different situations. In philosophy and cognitive science, this error is called “bandwagoning,” and it’s one of the most well-known cognitive biases.<br><br>

What you consider a “cognitive bias” depends on what your standards of reasoning are. No one is capable of complete rationality – we have to make decisions all the time based on limited information, and we use instinct, emotions, and prior teachings as a guide. There’s nothing wrong with that. But we all have certain standards or guides that help us think logically– not making big decisions while angry or tired, for example. Cognitive biases are the mental tendencies that prevent us from living up to those standards and being completely rational.<br><br>

While this article lists some basic cognitive biases that have been observed by philosophers and behavior scientists, it’s a long way from a complete list – there are literally thousands of cognitive biases out there. Depending on your standards of rationality, different kinds of mental habits will count as obstacles to that rationality, and this will determine your list of cognitive bias.<br><br>

The lists will also vary because not everyone’s brain works in the same way. Your brain has its own particular habits of thought, and they’re different from everyone else’s. That means there may be cognitive biases that other people suffer from but you don’t, while your own biases may or may not be shared by others.<br><br>

Cognitive biases are closely related to logical fallacies, but cognitive biases exist in a mind whereas logical fallacies exist in an argument. One way to think of it would be that when you read a faulty argument, you may fall for its fallacies because your cognitive biases are clouding your vision.</p><br><br>

				<p>A <b style="font-family: bold;">fallacy</b> is the use of <u style="color: blue;">invalid</u> or otherwise faulty <u style="color: blue;">reasoning</u>, or "wrong moves" in the construction of an <u style="color: blue;">argument</u>. A fallacious argument may be deceptive by appearing to be better than it really is. Some fallacies are committed intentionally to <u style="color: blue;">manipulate</u> or <u style="color: blue;">persuade</u> by <u style="color: blue;">deception</u>, while others are committed unintentionally due to carelessness or ignorance. The <u style="color: blue;">soundness</u> of <u style="color: blue;">legal arguments</u> depends on the context in which the arguments are made.<br><br>

Fallacies are commonly divided into "formal" and "informal". A <u style="color: blue;">formal fallacy</u> can be expressed neatly in a standard system of logic, such as <u style="color: blue;">propositional logic</u>, while an <u style="color: blue;">informal fallacy</u> originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form. Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally <u style="color: blue;">valid</u>, but still fallacious.br><br><br>

A special case is a <u style="color: blue;">mathematical fallacy</u>, an intentionally invalid <u style="color: blue;">mathematical proof</u>, often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of spurious proofs of obvious <u style="color: blue;">contradictions</u>.<br><br>

Fallacies are defects that weaken arguments. Fallacious arguments are very common and can be persuasive in common use. They may be even "unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts". Informal fallacies in particular are found frequently in mass media such as television and newspapers. It is important to understand what fallacies are so that one can recognize them in either one's own or others' writing. Avoiding fallacies will strengthen one's ability to produce strong arguments.<br><br>

It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of <u style="color: blue;">soundness</u> and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones.<br><br>

"Fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments." Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in <u style="color: blue;">rhetorical</u> patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the <u style="color: blue;">emotional</u>, intellectual, or <u style="color: blue;">psychological</u> weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true.<br><br>

<u style="color: blue;">Argumentation theory</u> provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In this approach, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals that attempts to resolve their disagreements. The protocol is regulated by certain rules of interaction, so violations of these rules are fallacies.<br><br>

Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the <u style="color: blue;">mass media</u> today include but are not limited to <u style="color: blue;">propaganda, advertisements, politics</u>, newspaper editorials and opinion-based “news” shows.</p><br><br>
