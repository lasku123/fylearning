<u style="color: blue;">Freedom of action</u> is the property of being free from constraints, especially from external constraints on our actions, but also from internal constraints such as physical disabilities or addictions. Political freedoms, such as the right to speak, to assemble, and the limits to government constraints on associations and organizations such as media and religions, are examples of external freedom.<br><br>
<u style="color: blue;">Isaiah Berlin</u> called this kind of freedom "negative" in his essay Two Concepts of Liberty. Lack of external and internal constraints - Berlin's "negative freedom" - is usually called "<u style="color: blue;">freedom of action</u>."<br><br>

But there is another, more philosophical form of liberty that Berlin called "positive freedom." This kind of liberty raises the ancient question of "<u style="color: blue;">freedom of the will</u>." One can be free to act, that is free of constraints, even if one's will is determined by the laws of nature. Such a position is known as <u style="color: blue;">compatibilism</u>.<br><br>

Quite apart from whether we are free to act, are we free to will our actions?<br><br>

This Freedom section of Information Philosopher is a critical study of the "<u style="color: blue;">problem of free will</u>."<br><br>

From the original philosophical debates among the <u style="color: blue;">ancient Greeks</u> down to the current day, the arguments of hundreds of <u style="color: blue;">philosophers</u> and <u style="color: blue;">scientists</u> have been researched and are reported on web pages here, resources for use by students and scholars everywhere.<br><br>

Dozens of critical concepts in the free will debates, frequently jargon-laden, are presented on individual web pages (linked to from the left-hand column of this Freedom section).<br><br>
You will also find briefer definitions of some jargon in an extensive <u style="color: blue;">glossary of terms.</u><br><br>

					<div id="word"><p><b style="font-family: arial black; color: blue;">The Real Essence of Freedom</b><br><br>

<b style="font-family: arial bold;">Having freedom to do good</b> opens the door to having the freedom to do bad, or to waste one's life entirely. Such is the nature of freedom. It allows us to decide who we are and what we do.<br><br>

    The freedom we espouse is something different. It presupposes a personal authenticity that is rooted in conscience. Without a healthy, on-going integration of conscience, the individual is incomplete. Freedom loses its purpose. One might rejoice from being free from the iron grip of the tyrant, while never realizing the true benefits of freedom that make us complete.<br><br>

    Freedom should not be seen as license to just do as one pleases. It is a challenge to complete the length, breadth and depth of one's life in the time allotted. Freedom, and nothing less, makes that possible by giving life to virtue, thereby completing who we really are.<br><br>

    A knave may be free to exploit people, or commit crimes, or turn his back on the needy, but we sense immediately that his own depth of conscience is missing. Perhaps it is shackled or buried alive, or ignored to obsolescence. Without that vital part of him engaged, and the virtues that arise from it, he in only a pompous shell of his life, and for no one's benefit-not even his own. He has not just adopted an unjust path, he had denied his truest being. He is reason for us to mourn.<br><br>

    <b style="font-family: arial bold;">Chivalry-Now</b> does not trifle with freedom. It points to conscience as our own manifestation of Nature's Law. Its claim for autonomy stems from that. It is a claim for the autonomy of virtue, not of selfishness. There is more to human nature than presently meets the eye, and we seek to raise and honor it. This amounts to a kind of rebirth, through which we no longer view the world as a child. Ego is set aside in order for conscience to shone forth. Once you understand this fully, once you taste it, you will find that the truth does indeed set you free.<br><br>

    <b style="font-family: arial bold;">Chivalry-Now</b> holds this concept of freedom at its core. It does not look for followers, or people willing to relinquish their responsibility to conscience for title or for wealth. <br><br>

    For this reason, we bow in reverence to no one. We bow instead to ideals that define us at our best, and serve humanity itself by doing so.<br><br></p></div>

					<div id="word"><p><b style="font-family: arial black; color: blue;">The Philosophy of Freedom</b><br><br>

<b style="font-family: bold;">The Philosophy of Freedom</b> is the fundamental philosophical work of the <u style="color: blue;">philosopher</u> and <u style="color: blue;">esotericist Rudolf Steiner</u> (1861â€“1925). It addresses the questions whether and in what sense human beings can be said to be free.<br><br>

Part One of The Philosophy of Freedom examines the basis for freedom in human thinking, gives an account of the relationship between knowledge and perception, and explores the role and reliability of thinking as a means to knowledge. In Part Two Steiner analyzes the conditions necessary for human beings to be free, and develops a <u style="color: blue;">moral philosophy</u> that he describes as "ethical individualism". The book's subtitle, Some results of introspective observation following the methods of natural science, indicates the philosophical method Steiner intends to follow.<br><br>

Originally published in 1894 in <u style="color: blue;">German</u> as Die Philosophie der Freiheit, with a second edition published in 1918, the work has appeared under a number of <u style="color: blue;">English titles</u>, including The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity (the title Steiner proposed for the English-language translation), The Philosophy of Freedom, and Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path.<br><br>

					<div id="word"><p><b style="font-family: arial black;">Freedom</b>, generally, is having an ability to act or change without constraint. A thing is "free" if it can change its state easily and is not constrained in its present state. In philosophy and religion, it is associated with having <u style="color: blue;">free will</u> and being without undue or unjust constraints, or <u style="color: blue;">enslavement</u>, and is an idea closely related to the concept of <u style="color: blue;">liberty</u>. A person has the freedom to do things that will not, in theory or in practice, be prevented by other forces. Outside of the human realm, freedom generally does not have this political or psychological dimension. A rusty lock might be oiled so that the key has freedom to turn, undergrowth may be hacked away to give a newly planted sapling freedom to grow, or a mathematician may study an equation having many degrees of freedom. In mechanical engineering, "freedom" describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body or system, which is generally referred to as <u style="color: blue;">degrees of freedom</u>."<br><br>

In philosophical discourse, freedom is discussed in the context of <u style="color: blue;">free will</u> and self-determination, balanced by <u style="color: blue;">moral responsibility</u>.<br><br>

Advocates of free will regard freedom of thought as innate to the human mind, while opponents regard the mind as thinking only the thoughts that a purely deterministic brain happens to be engaged in at the time.<br><br>

					<div id="word"><p><b style="font-family: arial black; color: red;">Social freedom or liberty</b><br><br>

In political discourse, <u style="color: blue;">political freedom</u> is often associated with <u style="color: blue;">liberty</u> and <u style="color: blue;">autonomy</u> in the sense of "giving oneself one's own laws", and with having <u style="color: blue;">rights</u> and the <u style="color: blue;">civil liberties</u> with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state. Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include <u style="color: blue;">freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of choice</u>, and <u style="color: blue;">freedom of speech</u>.<br><br>


In some circumstances, particularly when discussion is limited to political freedoms, the terms "freedom" and "liberty" tend to be used interchangeably. Elsewhere, however, subtle distinctions between freedom and liberty have been noted. <u style="color: blue;">John Stuart Mill</u>, differentiated liberty from freedom in that freedom is primarily, if not exclusively, the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved. As such, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others.<br><br>


Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explains the differences in terms of their relation to institutions:<br><br>


Liberty is linked to human subjectivity; freedom is not. The Declaration of Independence, for example, describes men as having liberty and the nation as being free. Free willâ€”the quality of being free from the control of fate or necessityâ€”may first have been attributed to human will, but <u style="color: blue;">Newtonian physics</u> attributes freedomâ€”<u style="color: blue;">degrees of freedom, free bodies</u>â€”to objects.<br><br>


Freedom differs from liberty as control differs from discipline. Liberty, like discipline, is linked to institutions and political parties, whether liberal or libertarian; freedom is not. Although freedom can work for or against institutions, it is not bound to themâ€”it travels through unofficial networks. To have liberty is to be liberated from something; to be free is to be self-determining, autonomous. Freedom can or cannot exist within a state of liberty: one can be liberated yet unfree, or free yet enslaved (Orlando Patterson has argued in Freedom: Freedom in the Making of Western Culture that freedom arose from the yearnings of slaves).<br><br>


Another distinction that some political theorists have deemed important is that people may aspire to have freedom from limiting forces (such as <u style="color: blue;">freedom from fear, freedom from want</u>, and <u style="color: blue;">freedom from discrimination</u>), but descriptions of freedom and liberty generally do not invoke having liberty from anything. To the contrary, the concept of <u style="color: blue;">negative liberty</u> refers to the liberty one person may have to restrict the rights of others.<br><br>


Other important fields in which freedom is an issue include <u style="color: blue;">economic freedom, academic freedom, intellectual freedomM</u>, and <u style="color: blue;">scientific freedom</u>.<br><br>

					<div id="word"><p><b style="font-family: arial black; color: red;">Freedom as a physical concept</b><br><br>

In purely physical terms, freedom is used much more broadly to describe the limits to which physical movement or other physical processes are possible. This relates to the philosophical concept to the extent that people may be considered to have as much freedom as they are physically able to exercise. The number of independent <u style="color: blue;">variables</u> or parameters for a system is described as its number of <u style="color: blue;">degrees of freedom</u>. For example the movement of a vehicle along a road has two degrees of freedom; to go fast or slow, or to change direction by turning left or right. The movement of a ship sailing on the waves has four degrees of freedom, since it can also pitch nose-to-tail and roll side-to-side. An aeroplane can also climb and sideslip, giving it <u style="color: blue;">six degrees of freedom</u>.<br><br>

<u style="color: blue;">Degrees of freedom in mechanics</u> describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body, or, in case of a <u style="color: blue;">mechanism</u> made of several bodies, the number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism. In the study of complex <u style="color: blue;">motor control</u>, there may be so many degrees of freedom that a given action can be achieved in different ways by combining movements with different degrees of freedom. This issue is sometimes called the <u style="color: blue;">degrees of freedom problem</u>.<br><br>

					<div id="word"><p><b style="font-family: arial black; color: red;">Freedom in mathematical theory</b><br><br>

In <u style="color: blue;">mathematics</u> freedom is the ability of a <u style="color: blue;">variable</u> to change in value.<br><br>

Some equations have many such variables. This notion is formalized as the <u style="color: blue;">dimension</u> of a <u style="color: blue;">manifold</u> or an <u style="color: blue;">algebraic variety</u>. When degrees of freedom is used instead of dimension, this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined. Such degrees of freedom appear in many mathematical and related disciplines, including <u style="color: blue;">degrees of freedom</u> as used in <u style="color: blue;">physics</u> and <u style="color: blue;">chemistry</u> to explain dependence on <u style="color: blue;">parameters</u>, or the <u style="color: blue;">dimensions</u> of a <u style="color: blue;">phase space</u>; and <u style="color: blue;">degrees of freedom in statistics</u>, the number of values in the final calculation of a <u style="color: blue;">statistic</u> that are free to vary.<br><br>
