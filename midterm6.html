				<p>The <b style="font-family: bold;">philosophy of environment</b> is a trend of free thought located between philosophy, epistemology and anthropology. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental humanism. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.<br><br>

The philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the neo-darwinian school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex living being in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.This trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by Julian Huxley, notably during the founders congress of the IHEU (International Humanist and Ethical Union) in 1952.<br><br>

Further than the basic scientific theory of evolution (notably neo-darwinian, Evolutive Humanism, developed by Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould), looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal environment. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of evolution and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose determinism, genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to Marc Carl, "Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally".<br><br>

 <b style="font-family: bold;">Environmental philosophy</b> is a branch of <u style="color: blue;">philosophy</u> that is concerned with the <u style="color: blue;">natural environment</u> and humans' place within it.It asks crucial questions about human environmental relations such as "What do we mean when we talk about nature?" "What is the value of the natural, that is non-human environment to us, or in itself?" "How should we respond to environmental challenges such as <u style="color: blue;">environmental degradation</u>, pollution and climate change?" "How can we best understand the relationship between the natural world and human technology and development?" and "What is our place in the natural world?" As such, it uniquely positions itself as a field set to deal with the challenges of the 21st Century. Environmental philosophy includes <u style="color: blue;">environmental ethics</u>, environmental aesthetics, <u style="color: blue;">ecofeminism, environmental hermeneutics,</u> and <u style="color: blue;">environmental theology</u>. Some of the main areas of interest for environmental philosophers are:</p><br><br>

 <ul>
 	<li>• Defining environment and nature</li><br>
 	<li>• How to value the environment</li><br>
 	<li>• Moral status of animals and plants</li><br>
 	<li>• Endangered species</li><br>
 	<li>• Environmentalism and Deep Ecology</li><br>
 	<li>• Aesthetic value of nature</li><br>
 	<li>• Restoration of nature</li><br>
 	<li>• Consideration of future generations</li><br>
 </ul><br><br>

<p>This cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of human evolution, an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, non-deterministic because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated metaphysics, encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.</p><br><br>

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about <u style="color: blue;">personal identity</u> and <u style="color: blue;">self</u>: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another,and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.</p><br><br>

According to Thomas Merton (1948), a Trappist monk, there is no other way for us to find who we are than by finding in ourselves the divine image. We have to struggle to regain spontaneous and vital awareness of our own spirituality. <br><br>

A. <u style="color: blue;">HINDUISM:</u> Reincarnation and Karma
Essential Hinduism is based on the belief in karma and has its first literary expression in Upanishads. Everything in this life is a consequence of actions performed in previous existence.For the Jains, there is nothing migthier in the world than karma; karma tramples down all powers. <br><br> 

B. <u style="color: blue;">BUDDHISM:</u> Nirvana
Nirvana means the state in which one is absolutely free from all forms of bondage and attachment. It means to overcome and remove the cause of suffering. It is also who is unencumbered from all the fetters that bind a human being in existence.<br><br>

The Buddha's silence is due to his awareness that nirvana is a state that transcends every mundane experience and cannot be talked about. Nirvana is beyond the sense, language and thought. This way of life conforms to Buddha's teaching that wisdom consists in treading the Middle Way, avoiding the extreme of asceticism, inactivity and indifference on the one hand and that of frantic activity and mindless pursuit of pleasure on the other.

	       evaporating on blades of<br> grass, like candle flickering in a stormy wind, echoes, mirages, and<br> phantoms 
	       hallucinations and like a dream." - The Buddha</center><br>
	       Buddhism, is a major Eastern tradition, contained in the teachings of it's founder, Siddharta Gautama or The Buddha. The teaching of Buddha has been set forth traditionally in the "Four Noble Truths" leading to the "Eightfold Path" to perfect character or arhatship, which in turn gave assurance of entrance into Nirvana (enlightened wisdom) at death.

            1. Right belief and acceptance of the "Fourfold Truth"
2. Right aspiration for one's self and for others
3. Right speech that harms no one
4. Right conduct, motivated by goodwill toward all human beings
5. Right means of livelihood or earning one's living by honourable means

<tr>	<td><div id="word"><p style="font-family: arial black; font-size: 20px; color: blue;"><br><br>HINDUISM</p><br><br>

	Human beings have a dual nature:<br> 
1. one is the spiritual and immortal essence (soul)<br>
2. empirical life and character.<br><br>
The existence of the body is considered as nothing more than an illusion and even an obstacle to an individual's realization of one's real self.
<br><br>
* Hindus generally believe that the soul is eternal but bound by the law of Karma (action) to the world of matter.<br>
* Transmigration or metempsychosis is a doctrine that adheres to the belief that a person's soul passes into some other creature, human, or animal.<br>
* Moksha is an enlightened state wherein one attains one's true selfhood and finds oneself with the One, the Ultimate Reality, the All-Comprehensive Reality: Brahman.<br>
* Samsara - Cycle of life and death; a state of "nothingness" <br>
* The goal of human life is conceived by the different Upanishads is to overcome congenital ignorance. The Upanishads or sometimes referred to as Vedanta, the concepts of Brahman and Atman (soul, self) are central ideas in all the Upanishads, with "Know your Atman" as their thematic focus.<br>
* For hinduism, one's whole duty is to achieve self-knowledge in order to achieve self-annihilation and absorption into the Great Self. <br>
* Hinduism is one of the oldest Eastern traditions, practiced by hundreds of millions of people for about 5,000 years.<br>

	A. FORGIVENESS
         When we forgive, we are freed from our anger and bitterness because of the actions and/or words of another.<br><br>

B. THE BEAUTY OF NATURE
          There is perfection in every single flower; this is what the three philosophies believed. For a hug, for every sunrise and sunset, to eat together as a family, are our miracles.<br><br>

C. VULNERABILITY
         To be invulnerable is somehow inhuman. To be vulnerable is to be human. The experience that we are contingent, that we are dependent for our existence on another is frightening.<br><br>

D. FAILURE
          Our failures force us to confront our weaknesses and limitation. When a relationship fails, when a student fails a subject, when our immediate desires are not met, we are confronted with the possibility of our plans and yet, we are forced to surrender to a mystery or look upon a bigger world.<br><br>

E. LONELINESS
            Our loneliness can be rooted from our sense of vulnerability and fear of death.<br><br>

F. LOVE
           To love is to experience richness, positivity and transcendence. Life is full of risks, fears and commitment, pain and sacrificing and giving up thing/s we want for the sake of the one we love.

		<br><br>
		This section looks at the reasonableness of beliefs in Gods existence . We shall treat the statement that "God exists" as a hypothesis, which we call the theistic hypothesis. For Augustine, Christianity,  as presenting the full revelation  of the true God is the only true and full philosophy.

A. It is the spiritual that endures and is ultimately real.<br><br>
B. There is the preoccupation with the inner life the road to enlightenment that stretches not outward but inward.<br><br>
C. There is an emphasis on the non-material oneness of creation.<br><br>
D. There is the acceptance of direct awareness as the only way to understand what is real.<br><br>
E. There is a healthy respect for tradition but never a slavish commitment to it.<br><br>

<center><p style="font-family: arial black; font-size: 15px; color: black;">Evil And Suffering</center></p><br><br>

	Suffering is close to the heart of biblical faith. In comparison with the Buddha, who saw life in suffering and tried to control it instead of cursing it, Job, of the Old Testament, did not just complain.<br>
In, Christianity, suffering leads to the Cross, the symbol of reality of God's saving love for the human being. Suffering, in Buddhism, gives rise to comparison for suffering humanity.<br><br>
